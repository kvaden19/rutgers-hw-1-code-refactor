# Horiseon's Landing Page: Accessibility Refactor

## Description 

Horiseon, a digital marketing agency, originally had a functional and aesthetically pleasing website, but it was lacking in accessibility. 

In this project I overhauled the site's HTML and CSS to improve accessibility. Function and layout remain the same, but the underlying code now includes the following accessibility improvements: 

* All non-semantic HTML elements have been replaced with semantic elements
* HTML elements follow a logical structure
* All images have "alt" attributes

This refactor will deliver a much better user experience for anyone accessing Horiseon's site with a screen reader. It should also improve Horiseon's search engine results, which is crucial since they themselves are a digital marketing firm offering SEO. 

In addition, I have done some basic link clean-up and CSS consolidation. This will make future updates to Horiseon's pages easier. 

With this project I was able to get hands-on experience with semantic HTML elements and will be using them for my own projects going forward. With some careful attention to each CSS property and what it targets, I was also able to reduce the style sheet from 200 lines to under 150.
